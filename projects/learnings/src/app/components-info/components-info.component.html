    <p class="brief">
        Here all the components - On clicking in the menu, see the route change and component is rendered. The Component is the main
        building block of an Angular Application. A Component contains the definition of the View and the data that defines
        how the View looks and behaves. The Angular Components are plain javascript classes and defined using @component
        Decorator. This Decorator provides the component with the View to display & Metadata about the class. The Component
        passes the data to the view using a process called Data Binding. This is done by Binding the DOM Elements to component
        properties. Binding can be used to display component class property values to the user, change element styles, respond
        to a user event, etc.

        <h2>Creating the Component File</h2>
        <pre class="brief">
            The Component app.component.ts. is already been created for us by Angular CLI under the folder src.
            By Convention, the file name starts with the feature name (app) and then followed by the type of class (component).
            These are separated by a dot. The extension used is ts indicating that this is a typescript module file.
            Directly can be created using <code class="highlight">`&lt;ng g c (ng generate component) <b>componentname</b>&gt;`</code>

        <h2>Data binding</h2>
        <div class="brief">
            Data binding is a technique, where the data stays in sync between the component and the view.
            Whenever the user updates the data in the view, Angular updates the component.
            When the component gets new data, the Angular updates the view.

                        <li>Property Binding
<pre class="brief">The Property binding allows us to bind HTML element property to a property in the component.
Whenever the value of the component changes, the Angular updates the element property in the View.
You can set the properties such as class, href, src, textContent, etc using property binding.
You can also use it to set the properties of custom components or directives (properties decorated with @Input).</pre>
